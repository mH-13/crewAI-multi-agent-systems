![crewAI Logo](https://crewai.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CrewAI-logo-white-bg.png)

This repository contains my coursework, projects, and learning materials from the "Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI" course. It demonstrates how to design and implement teams of AI agents to automate complex, multi-step business processes.

## Key Features

- Implementation of multi-agent systems using crewAI
- Practical business automation examples
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- Course notes and key concepts
- Custom agent configurations and tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-systems-with-crewAI.git
cd multi-agent-systems-with-crewAI
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Course Concepts Implemented

- Role-playing agents with specialized roles
- Agent memory systems (short-term, long-term, shared)
- Custom tools for agent capabilities
- Task decomposition and assignment
- Error handling and guardrails
- Agent cooperation patterns (series, parallel, hierarchical)

## Featured Projects

1. **Resume Tailoring System**: AI crew that customizes resumes for specific job descriptions
2. **Technical Writing Team**: Agents that research, write, and edit technical articles
3. **Customer Support Automation**: Multi-agent system for handling support inquiries
4. **Event Planning Crew**: AI team that plans and coordinates events
5. **Financial Analysis Agents**: Team that performs market research and analysis

## Key Learnings

- Designing effective AI agent teams
- Breaking down complex tasks into agent workflows
- Optimizing agent performance through specialized roles
- Implementing memory and context sharing
- Building custom tools for agent capabilities
- Error handling in multi-agent systems
